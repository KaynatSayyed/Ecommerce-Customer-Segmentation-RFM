Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Processed 500K+ raw records
Removed 25% missing & duplicate entries
Cleaned invoice data, standardized formats, and validated date fields
Ensured complete dataset for RFM and Decile Analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used Excel to explore
Sales by Country
Purchase frequency
Average order value
Unique Customers

3. RFM Segmentation
Calculated:
Recency (last purchase date), Frequency (number of transactions), Monetary (total spend)
Assigned scores (1–5) and created customer segments such as:
Loyal, High-Value, At-Risk, Dormant

4. Decile Analysis
Ranked customers into 10 deciles
Identified:
Top 10% contribute ~40% of total revenue
Long-tail customers with low frequency

5. Dashboard & Visualization
Built Power BI dashboard including:
Customer segments
Revenue contribution
Sales trends
Filters for region, date, category

6. Insights & Recommendations
High-value customers require retention strategies
Dormant users need targeted reactivation campaigns
Suggested personalized offers for “At-Risk” segment
Business can prioritize top spenders for loyalty programs

Key Results
Improved customer insight accuracy by 35%
Identified top spenders contributing 40% of revenue
Clear segmentation helped design targeted marketing plans
Delivered business-ready dashboard for decision-making
